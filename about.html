            <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site!</h1>
            <p>
              After over 5 years of teaching experience with different levels of
              students, I found myself either designing things or contemplating
              on designing things as I've always did throughout my life whenever
              I had the chance or time to take out from the teaching routine. So
              I finally realized that it is not where I want to be and where I
              want to see myself in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am currently studying graphic & web design and Javascript trying
              to get the hang of both front and back end, and designing toys,
              drawing, making, engineering my days at the same. In the meantime
              I am looking for an opportuniy that will give me an insight into
              the industry, help me gain more knowledge while I am contributing
              to the needs of the team I will be working with. While I am on my
              way to find my niche, I am still in the process of learning, and
              forever will be..
            </p>

            <p>
              On my homepage, you can see some examples of my graphic designs on
              various topics, a website that I have designed along with my
              portfolio website and some of my toy designs.
